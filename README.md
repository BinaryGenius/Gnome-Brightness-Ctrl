## Wayland
There is an excellent extension called soft brightness you can download using Extension Manager.

It has many quality of life features like a brightness slider and unbrightened screen shots, basically it resets the brightness temporarily so the images stay well lit. Check it out [here](https://github.com/F-i-f/soft-brightness).

## Xorg
Now the same extension could be used for Xorg but unfortunately there is a really annoying [issue](https://github.com/F-i-f/soft-brightness/issues/31) that prevents you from doing so. I use this [script](https://github.com/zb3/gnome-gamma-tool) to circumvent this.

## Install
Just run `install.sh` from the terminal and follow the prompts.
